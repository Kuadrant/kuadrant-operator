              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                      * Gateway: Listener name
                      * HTTPRoute: HTTPRouteRule name
                      * Service: Port name

                      If a SectionName is specified, but does not exist on the targeted object,
                      the Policy must fail to attach, and the policy implementation should record
                      a `ResolvedRefs` or similar Condition in the Policy's status.
