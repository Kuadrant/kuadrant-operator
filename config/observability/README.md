# Observability stack guide

## Deploying the observabilty stack

```bash
./bin/kustomize build ./config/observability/| docker run --rm -i ryane/kfilt -i kind=CustomResourceDefinition | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
./bin/kustomize build ./config/observability/| docker run --rm -i ryane/kfilt -x kind=CustomResourceDefinition | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will deploy prometheus, alertmanager and grafana into the `monitoring` namespace,
along with metrics scrape configuration for Istio and Envoy.

## Accessing Grafana & Prometheus

Use port forwarding to access Grafana & Prometheus:

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000
```

The Grafana UI can be found at [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) (default user/pass of `admin` & `admin`).
It is pre-loaded with some kubernetes and [gateway-api-state](https://github.com/Kuadrant/gateway-api-state-metrics) dashboards.

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward service/prometheus-k8s 9090:9090
```

The Prometheus UI can be found at [http://127.0.0.1:9090](http://127.0.0.1:9090).

## Editing dashboards

Dashboards can be imported in the Grafana UI using either raw JSON, a JSON file, or the URL/ID of one of the [dashboards on grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/).
Some example dashboards are available in the [/examples](/examples) folder.

To import a dashboard, click on the plus icon on the left sidebar and navigate to **Import**. After entering a dashboard URL/ID or JSON, click **Load**.

After loading the dashboard, the next screen allows you to select a name and folder for the dashboard and specify the data source before finally importing the dashboard.

Grafana dashboards can be exported as JSON in order to add them to the project's git repo.
When viewing the dashboard you wish to export, click on the **share** button at the top of the screen.

In the modal popup click **Export** and then **Save to file**.

## Editing alerting rules

Alerting rules can be defined in [PrometheusRules](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/alerting.md#configuring-alertmanager-in-prometheus) resources.
The can be viewed in the Prometheus UI Alerts tab.
Some example alerting rules are available in the [/examples](/examples) folder.

## Exporting a dashboard for use with Grafana Community Platform or other Grafana Instances

Following the steps in [Editing dashboards](#editing-dashboards), we need to make one export where the toggle "Export for sharing manually" is toggled. Once this is saved, run the following from `config/observability` . 

```bash
universal-dashboard.sh <"Export for sharing manually" JSON file> /path/to/<JSON file>
```

Now, you have a universal dashboard file you can use to import into your Grafana instance, but also use for uploading to the Grafana Community Platform.
