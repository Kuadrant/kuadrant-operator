# We're using the additionalScrapeConfigs field of the Prometheus CR
# here to read existing prometheus scrape annotations on pods.
# Ideally this would be done via another PodMonitor or ServicMonitor,
# however that isn't possible as the container port 15020 is not 
# exposed or named, so we need to drop to raw custom prometheus
# scrape config.
