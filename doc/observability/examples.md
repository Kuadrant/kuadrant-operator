## Dashboards

### Importing Dashboards into Grafana

For more details on how to import dashboards into Grafana, visit the [import dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/import-dashboards/) page. 

- **UI Method:**
    - **JSON** -  Use the 'Import' feature in the Grafana UI to upload dashboard JSON files directly.
    - **ID** - Use the 'Import' feature in the Grafana UI to import via [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) using a Dashboard ID. 
- **ConfigMap Method:** Automate dashboard provisioning by adding files to a ConfigMap, which should be mounted at `/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards`.

Datasources are configured as template variables, automatically integrating with your existing data sources. Metrics for these dashboards are sourced from [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus). For more details on the metrics used, visit the [metrics](https://docs.kuadrant.io/kuadrant-operator/doc/observability/metrics/) documentation page.
