# Secure, Protect and Connect services with Kuadrant

## Pre-requisites

- Completed the [Single-cluster Quick Start](https://docs.kuadrant.io/getting-started-single-cluster/)

## Overview

In this guide, we will cover the different policies from Kuadrant and how you can use them to secure, protect and connect an Istio-controlled gateway in a single cluster, and how you can set more refined protection on the HTTPRoutes exposed by that gateway.

Here are the steps we will go through:

1) [Deploy a sample application](#-deploy-the-example-app-we-will-serve-via-our-gateway)
2) [Define a new Gateway](#-define-a-new-istio-managed-gateway)
3) [Ensure TLS-based secure connectivity to the gateway with a TLSPolicy](#-define-the-tlspolicy)
4) [Define a default RateLimitPolicy to set some infrastructure limits on your gateway](#-define-infrastructure-rate-limiting)
5) [Define a default AuthPolicy to deny all access to the gateway](#-define-the-gateway-authpolicy)
6) [Define a DNSPolicy to bring traffic to the gateway](#-define-the-dnspolicy)
7) [Override the Gateway's deny-all AuthPolicy with an endpoint-specific policy](#-override-the-gateways-deny-all-authpolicy)
8) [Override the Gateway rate limits with an endpoint-specific policy](#-override-the-gateways-ratelimitpolicy)

To help with this walk through, you should set a `KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN` environment variable to a domain you want to use. If it you want to try DNSPolicy, this should also be a domain you have access to the DNS for in AWS Route53 or GCP. E.g.:

```sh
export KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN=my.domain.iown
```

### ❶ Deploy the example app we will serve via our gateway

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/main/examples/toystore/toystore.yaml
```

### ❷ Define a new Istio-managed gateway

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
  namespace: kuadrant-system
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio
  listeners:
  - allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
    name: api
    hostname: "*.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN"
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
        - name: apps-hcpapps-tls
          kind: Secret
EOF
```

If you take a look at the gateway status, you will see a TLS status error similar to the following:

```
message: invalid certificate reference /Secret/apps-hcpapps-tls. secret kuadrant-system/apps-hcpapps-tls not found
```

This is because currently there is not a TLS secret in place. Let's fix that by creating a TLSPolicy.

### ❸ Define the TLSPolicy

Note: For convenience, in the setup, we have created a self-signed CA as a cluster issuer in the Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: TLSPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-tls
  namespace: kuadrant-system
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: api-gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
  issuerRef:
    group: cert-manager.io
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: kuadrant-operator-glbc-ca
EOF

kubectl wait tlspolicy api-gateway-tls -n kuadrant-system --for=condition=ready
```

Now, if you look at the status of the gateway, you will see the error is gone, and the status of the policy will report the listener as now secured with a TLS certificate and the gateway as affected by the TLS policy.

Our communication with our gateway is now secured via TLS. Note that any new listeners will also be handled by the TLSPolicy.

Let's define a HTTPRoute and test our policy. We will re-use this later on with some of the other policies as well.

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: toystore
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: api-gateway
    namespace: kuadrant-system
  hostnames:
  - "api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - method: GET
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: "/cars"
    - method: GET
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: "/dolls"
    backendRefs:
    - name: toystore
      port: 80
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: "/admin"
    backendRefs:
    - name: toystore
      port: 80
EOF
```

With this HTTPRoute in place, the service we deployed is exposed via the gateway. We should be able to access our endpoint via HTTPS:

```sh
export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl get gtw api-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}' -n kuadrant-system)

curl -k --resolve api.${KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN}:443:${INGRESS_HOST} "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars"
```

### ❹ Define Infrastructure Rate Limiting

We have a secure communication in place. However, there is nothing limiting users from overloading our infrastructure and service components that will sit behind this gateway. Let's add a rate limiting layer to protect our services and infrastructure.

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: infra-ratelimit
  namespace: kuadrant-system
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: api-gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
  limits:
    "global":
      rates:
      - limit: 5
        duration: 10
        unit: second
EOF

kubectl wait ratelimitpolicy infra-ratelimit -n kuadrant-system --for=condition=available
```

The limit here is artificially low in order for us to show it working easily. Let's test it with our endpoint:

```sh
for i in {1..10}; do curl -k --resolve api.${KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN}:443:${INGRESS_HOST} "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars" && sleep 1; done
```

We should see `409`s start returning after the 5th request.

### ❺ Define the Gateway AuthPolicy

Communication is secured and we have some protection for our infrastructure, but we do not trust any client to access our endpoints. By default, we want to allow only authenticated access. To protect our gateway, we will add a _deny-all_ AuthPolicy. Later, we will override this with a more specific AuthPolicy for the API.

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: kuadrant-system
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: api-gateway
  rules:
    authorization:
      deny-all:
        opa:
          rego: "allow = false"
    response:
      unauthorized:
        headers:
          "content-type":
            value: application/json
        body:
          value: |
            {
              "error": "Forbidden",
              "message": "Access denied by default by the gateway operator. If you are the administrator of the service, create a specific auth policy for the route."
            }
EOF
```

Let's test it again. This time we expect a `403`.

```sh
curl -k --resolve api.${KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN}:443:${INGRESS_HOST}  "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars"
```

### ❻ Define the DNSPolicy

(Skip this step if you did not configure a DNS provider during the setup.)

Now, we have our gateway protected and communications secured. We are ready to configure DNS, so it is easy for clients to connect and access the APIs we intend to expose via this gateway. Note that during the setup of this walk through, we created a DNS Provider secret and a ManagedZone resource.

```sh
kubectl --context kind-kuadrant-local apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: DNSPolicy
metadata:
  name: simple-dnspolicy
  namespace: kuadrant-system
spec:
  routingStrategy: simple
  targetRef:
    name: api-gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
EOF

kubectl wait dnspolicy simple-dnspolicy -n kuadrant-system --for=condition=ready
```

If you want to see the DNSRecord created by the this policy, execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl get dnsrecord api-gateway-api -n kuadrant-system -o=yaml
```

So now we have a wildcard DNS record to bring traffic to our gateway.

Let's test it again. This time we expect a `403` still as the _deny-all_ policy is still in effect. Notice we no longer need to set the Host header directly.

```sh
curl -k  "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars" -i
```

### ❼ Override the Gateway's deny-all AuthPolicy

Next, we are going to allow authenticated access to our Toystore API. To do this, we will define an AuthPolicy that targets the HTTPRoute. Note that any new HTTPRoutes will still be affected by the gateway-level policy, but as we want users to now access this API, we need to override that policy. For simplicity, we will use API keys to authenticate the requests, though many other options are available.

Let's define an API Key for users **bob** and **alice**.

```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bob-key
  labels:
    authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino
    app: toystore
  annotations:
    secret.kuadrant.io/user-id: bob
stringData:
  api_key: IAMBOB
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: alice-key
  labels:
    authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino
    app: toystore
  annotations:
    secret.kuadrant.io/user-id: alice
stringData:
  api_key: IAMALICE
type: Opaque
EOF
```

Now, we will override the AuthPolicy to start accepting the API keys:

```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: toystore
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: toystore
  rules:
    authentication:
      "api-key-users":
        apiKey:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: toystore
        credentials:
          authorizationHeader:
            prefix: APIKEY
EOF
```

### ❽ Override the Gateway's RateLimitPolicy

The gateway limits are a good set of limits for the general case, but as the developers of this API we know that we only want to allow a certain number of requests to specific users, and a general limit for all other users.

```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: toystore
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: toystore
  limits:
    "general-user":
      rates:
      - limit: 1
        duration: 3
        unit: second
    "bob-limit":
      rates:
      - limit: 2
        duration: 3
        unit: second
      when:
      - selector: metadata.filter_metadata.envoy\.filters\.http\.ext_authz.identity.userid
        operator: eq
        value: bob
EOF
```

As just another example, we have given **bob** twice as many requests to use compared to everyone else.

Let's test this new setup.

By sending requests as **alice**:

```sh
while :; do curl -k --resolve api.${KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN}:443:${INGRESS_HOST} --write-out '%{http_code}\n' --silent --output /dev/null -H 'Authorization: APIKEY IAMALICE' "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars" | grep -E --color "\b(429)\b|$"; sleep 1; done
```

By sending requests as **bob**:

```sh
while :; do curl -k --resolve api.${KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN}:443:${INGRESS_HOST} --write-out '%{http_code}\n' --silent --output /dev/null -H 'Authorization: APIKEY IAMBOB' "https://api.$KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN/cars" | grep -E --color "\b(429)\b|$"; sleep 1; done
```
