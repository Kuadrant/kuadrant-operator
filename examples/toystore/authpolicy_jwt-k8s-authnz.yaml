# A Kuadrant AuthPolicy to protect an API with authentication based on OpenId Connect (OIDC) ID tokens (signed JWTs)
# and Kubernetes Service Account tokens combined, and authorization with permissions (bindings) stored in the
# Kubernetes RBAC, enforced by Authorino, Kuadrant's authorization service.
